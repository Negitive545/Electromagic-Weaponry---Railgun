# Electromagic Weaponry!
The set of all weapon mods I plan to create, based around the theme of electromagnetism (Or Electromagic if you will). This series of mods hopes to focus around sci-fi railguns and their possible iterations including stationary security buildings and handheld weapons!
## Railgun

The bread and butter of sci-fi magnet based weapons, the railgun. This wonderful piece of equipment accelerates a projectile to hypersonic velocities with the power of ELECTROMAGIC! While firing, the high amounts of electricity being utilized cause the weapon to fire a directed and localized EMP, which often disables shieldbelts before the projectile impacts. The EMP is weak enough that mechanoids aren't stunned for very long, but as a result they don't appear to adapt to the pulses.
This weapon sports an infinite range, high damage, and excellent armor penetration, but suffers from poor performance when your target closes the distance, and a rather lengthy warm-up time as the capacitors need time to charge before the weapon can launch it's projectile.

Finally, the weapon can be Overcharged, doing so causes it to create a large voltage difference between the atmosphere and the target, which results in a lightning strike! Additionally, this difference is sustained though ELECTROMAGIC for a minute, during which time the chances of a spontaneous lightning strike are heightened significantly!

Beware however, overcharging the weapon blows out the capacitors, and as such they need to be replaced before the weapon can be used in this way again.
## Capacitors

Capacitors, a wondeful component capable of rapidly storing and discharging electrical energy. These components are mandatory for anyone trying to get their hands on an Electromagical weaponry, they can be crafted, but require gold due to it's high electromagical conductivity.
